What is literate programming ?

\emph{
"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: \\
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do."}
\footnote{Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984} 
\newline
\emph{
”Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in
which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language,
such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code,
from which compilable source code can be generated.”}
