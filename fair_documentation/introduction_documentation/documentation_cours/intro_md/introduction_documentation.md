### Sommaire

The laboratory notebook
=======================

The aim
-------

Paper version

10cm(1cm,2cm) Laboratory notebook allow to:

-   Day-to-day recording each step in a process, experiments\...

-   Report on the progress, and scientific experimentations from the
    idea to final conclusions

-   Keep track of knowledge in a lab

-   Useful drafting a patent

-   Proof of anteriority

Paper version

This is a legal tool:

-   Page numbered in each notebook

-   Cover page with the owner of the results

-   Each page contain a part to date, to sign for at least to people

At each research level:

-   Researchers

-   Engineers

-   Technicians

-   Students\...

Markup {#markup .unnumbered}
------

Markup A markup language uses tags to deﬁne elements within a document.
Three different types and usage:

-   Presentational (used by traditional word-processing systems)

-   Procedural, provides instructions to process the text (e.g. TeX,
    PostScript)

-   Descriptive, to label documents parts (e.g. LaTeX, HTML, XML\...)

Markdown is a Lightweight markup language Designed to be:

-   easy to write using any generic text editor (plain-text-formatting
    syntax)

-   easy to read in the raw format

R notebook

1.  Sweave in 2002\
    *Leisch, Friedrich (2002). "Sweave, Part I: Mixing R and LaTeX: A
    short introduction to the Sweave ﬁle format and corresponding R
    functions"*

2.  knitR in 2011\
    *"The knitr package was designed to be a transparent engine for
    dynamic report generation with R, solve some long-standing problems
    in Sweave, and combine features in other add-on packages into one
    package"*

Jupyter

1.  2011: IPython (interactive Python shell) with notebook
    functionalities

2.  2014 : Spin-oﬀ project called Project Jupyter a non-proﬁt,
    open-source project maintained by a strong community

    -   "Jupyter will always be 100% open-source software, free for all
        to use and released under the liberal terms of the modiﬁed BSD
        license" [^2]

    -   A reference to the three core programming languages supported by
        Jupyter (Julia, Python and R)

Jupyter

-   Web-based: client/server

-   Interactive: notebook system

-   Computational environment: console, many kernels available\...
